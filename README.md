# Data-Engineering-Project

# This project demonstrates foundational data engineering and analytics skills, focusing on building ETL pipelines, exploring data trends, and visualizing insights. The analysis is performed on anonymized, publicly available datasets representing social media posts, trends, and product information.

Features:

	•	Implementation of ETL processes to extract and transform datasets.
	•	Exploration and visualization of trends and user engagement metrics.
	•	Text analysis, including word cloud generation and frequency analysis.
	•	Insights derived from segmented data and market share analysis.

Example Visualizations:

	•	Market share comparison using bar charts.
	•	Monthly trend growth via line charts.
	•	Engagement metrics (likes, comments, views) with grouped bar charts.
	•	Word cloud and word frequency analysis.

Disclaimer:

This project was inspired by a technical assessment but has been anonymized and recreated using publicly available data. It is intended for educational and demonstrative purposes.
